   <p>Rôle : 
      Starnina was probably a pupil of Antonio Veneziano. He is first documented in 1387
      in
      the records of the Compagnia di S. Luca (painters' guild) in Florence. Starnina was
      documented in Toledo, Spain in 1393, possibly with Antonio Veneziano, and in Valencia
      in
      the mid- and late 1390s. Documents indicate that he executed numerous commissions
      for
      frescoes and panel paintings in both towns, but no surviving works can be connected
      with
      certainty to these records. Various panels and frescoes by him survive in Italy and
      in
      museums around the world. There is ambiguity in the style of Starnina's works. He
      combines characteristics of Florentine painting, including depiction of
      three-dimensional space and figures, with elements of the Late Gothic style that he
      absorbed in Spain. Starnina probably played an important role in transmitting these
      Gothic forms to Florentine artists, including Lorenzo Monaco. Starnina was one of
      the
      most prolific and influential painters of his time in Florence, as is evident by the
      large number of works produced in his circle. His interest in issues regarding figural
      groupings and three-dimensional space anticipate the works of Masaccio. Starnina's
      work
      was long attributed to the anonymous Compagno di Agnolo Gaddi and to the anonymous
      Master of the Bambino Vispo. Many of the works formerly attributed to the Master of
      the
      Bambino Vispo are now believed to be by Starnina, but the entire oeuvre formerly
      attributed to the Master of the Bambino Vispo has generally not been identified with
      Starnina; thus some of this anonymous master's work are yet to be associated with
      a
      known artist. Starnina has also been linked to the works of the anonymous Gil Master
      (although these attributions are generally dismissed today). Italian painter, active
      Florence and Spain. Comment on works: Religious
