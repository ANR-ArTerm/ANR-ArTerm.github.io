   <p>Rôle : 
      Born and trained in Flanders (Douai, his birthplace, is now in France but was once
      in Flanders), Giambologna traveled to Italy in 1550 to study Classical and Renaissance
      sculpture. There, he became court sculptor of the Medici Dukes. He was famed for compositional
      sophistication, sensuous, tactile treatment of human body, and sheer technical virtuosity.
      He was extremely influential because the Medici gave his works as diplomatic gifts
      and his style was thus known throughout Europe. His style also spread through his
      many students, who studied in Florence with him, and returned to Northern Europe.
      He died in Florence, Italy in 1608.
