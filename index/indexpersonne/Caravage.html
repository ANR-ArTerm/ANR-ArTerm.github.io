   <p>Rôle : 
      An extremely original and influential artist, known for his decorum-defying naturalism,
      tenebrism, and method of painting 'alla prima.' His naturalism is dervied from Flemish
      art mediated through 16th-century Veneto-Lombard painting. This naturalism may have
      influenced his decision to paint in oil in a narrow range of earth colors. He is called
      'Caravaggio' after his birthplace near Milan. After an apprenticeship with Simone
      Peterzano, he moved to Rome circa 1588. His early secular works typically consist
      of half-length, often androgynous, figures set in a shallow space, typically with
      prominent, illusionistic still-life elements (he worked in the workshop of the Roman
      artist Giuseppe Cesari as a fruit and flower specialist). These paintings are often
      considered homoerotic and may embody poetical, allegorical, or emblematic conceits.
      Caravaggio had a number of high-ranking ecclesiastical patrons including Cardinal
      del Monte, who gave him his first monumental commission for the Contarelli chapel
      in S. Luigi dei Francesi. These paintings ("Calling of St. Matthew," "Martyrdom of
      St. Matthew," St. Matthew Writing his Gospel" (1599-1600) contain Caravaggio's earliest
      use of the tenebrism for which he is very well-known. The strong contrasts in light
      and dark are in keeping with the actual restricted light of the chapel and emphasize
      the spiritual significance of the painted scenes. Another important commission was
      for the controversial monumental paintings "Martyrdom of St. Peter" and "Conversion
      of St. Paul" (1600-01) for the Cerasi chapel in Sta Maria del Popolo. After these
      commissions, which depicted traditional subject matter in completely new ways, he
      almost exclusively painted large-scale religious pictures, for which he received many
      commissions. His turbulent life often led to scandal and in 1606 he fled Rome after
      killing his opponent in a brawl over a wager on a game of tennis. Wounded, he fled
      to Naples where he resumed painting monumental devotional works. He went to Malta
      in 1608 where he joined the Order of St. John; this was short-lived, however, and
      he was imprisoned after quarreling with a superior. After escaping and spending time
      in Sicily and again in Naples, he died of malarial fever while returning to Rome in
      hope of a pardon. His late religious paintings are in a new style in which all inessential
      elements are removed and the crowded drama and energy of his earlier paintings are
      replaced by a sense of quiet and contemplation. He had no pupils but he had a plethora
      of followers (the 'Caravaggisti'). Comment on works: Genre; Religious
