   <p>Rôle : 
      Dosso's birth date has been controversial for centuries. Modern research uncovered
      documents indicating that he had reached the age of 25 by June 1512, so it may be
      deduced that he was born some time before June 1487. According to another recently
      discovered document, at the likely time of Dosso's birth his father was living in
      the
      small principality of Mirandola, on the borders of Mantua and Ferrara; the nickname
      'Dosso', by which he was always known in his lifetime, refers to the place name of
      a
      small family property. Dosso was probably a pupil of Lorenzo Costa, court painter
      at
      Mantua, and he may have studied with Giorgione in Venice. He had settled in Ferrara
      by
      the summer of 1513, when he received payments, together with his collaborator Garofalo,
      for a huge polyptych commissioned by the ducal counselor Antonio Costabili. By the
      following year Dosso had entered the service of Duke Alfonso of Ferrara, for whom
      he
      worked all of his life. His art is characterized by its allegorical or mythological
      content, reflecting the cultural interests of the Ferrarese court. He was influenced
      by
      many artists, most notably Giorgione in Venice and Raphael in Rome. Although his style
      is often described as clumsy, he displayed great originality and experimented with
      the
      effects of light, glowing color, and the poetic quality of landscape. He was famous
      for
      his sense of humor, and his art may be interpreted in this light, reflecting heroic
      irony not unlike another person employed at the Ferrarese court, the great poet Lodovico
      Ariosto (1475-1533). He may have worked with Ariosto for the Este family devising
      entertainments, triumphs, tapestries, and other ephemeral art.
