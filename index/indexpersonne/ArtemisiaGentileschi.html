   <p>Rôle : 
      Artemesia Gentileschi was the most ambitious and influential female painter of her
      time. She spread the Caravaggesque style throughout Italy and expanded the narrow
      possibilities for female artists. Artemesia was taught to paint by her father, Orazio
      Gentileschi, who painted directly on the canvas and used live models. Her paint-handling
      in her early works reflects her father's influence, yet she also departed from him
      by
      choosing to paint tense, dramatic narratives starring female heroines. In 1612,
      Artemesia left Rome for Florence, after taking part in a trial against her art teacher,
      Agostino Tassi, who allegedly raped her. Shortly after, she painted her interpretation
      of Caravaggio's "Judith Beheading Holofernes," taking a more arresting and gruesome
      approach to the subject than was common at the time. In the 1620s, Artemesia was living
      again in Rome, making brief trips to Genoa and Venice and continuing to paint narrative
      paintings as well as female nudes, a subject shyed away from by other female artists
      of
      the period. In 1630, Artemesia had moved to Naples where her style became less
      Caravaggesque and her themes turned to more conventional religious subjects. In 1638
      Artemesia moved to London to care for ailing father. From then on, her work was less
      frequent and poorly documented. Her last commission was in January of 1654. Comment
