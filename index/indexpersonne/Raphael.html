   <p>Rôle : 
      Famed and influential Renaissance painter, noted for paintings of great beauty and
      harmony. His work epitomized Renaissance ideals of balance and ideal forms. His later
      works exhibit an interest in movement and emotion in narratives. He is best known
      for religious subjects, portraits, and historical scenes. He died young, at age 37.
      He was born 26 or 20 March 1483, and died 6 April 1520. He was trained as a painter;
      he entered the workshop of Perugino in Peugia ca. 1500. He went to Florence in 1504
      and to Rome probably in 1508. In 1514, Raphael was appointed "magister operis" in
      charge of the building of St. Peter's. In the six subsequent years, until his death
      in 1520, he directed for Pope Leo X some of the main works in Rome, including the
      Vatican Palace (1514-1515) and the Villa Madama (from 1518), and carried on architectural
      activity for various patrons.
