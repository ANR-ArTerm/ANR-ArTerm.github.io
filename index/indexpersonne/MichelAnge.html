   <p>Rôle : 
      In his time, Michelangelo was famous as a sculptor, painter, architect, and poet.
      He is remembered today as one of the chief creators of the High Renaissance in Florence
      and Rome, particularly in the arenas of sculpture and fresco painting. His professional
      career lasted over 70 years and included many stylistic changes. He was enormously
      influential to other artists. Michelangelo's father was the administrator of the small
      Florentine dependent town, Caprese. In Florence at age 13 (which was relatively late),
      Michelangelo became an apprentice to the city's most prominent painter, Domenico Ghirlandaio.
      His patron was the leading citizen and ruler of Florence, Lorenzo de' Medici. Michelangelo
      was typical of his period in that he excelled at and regarded the three arts of painting,
      sculpture, and architecture as manifestations of the fundamental discipline of "disegno"
      (drawing), which was itself based on a profound knowledge of the male human form.
