   <p>Rôle : 
      Born Antonio Allegri, Correggio was named after the town of his birth. His ability
      to manipulate light and shade to create luminous atmospheric effects was prized in
      religious paintings of the Italian Renaissance. Giorgio Vasari, a 16th-century biographer
      of artists, wrote, "everything that is to be seen by his hand is admired as something
      divine." Correggio was profoundly influenced by the style and technique used by the
      painter Andrea Mantegna. By the age of twenty-nine, Correggio was probably working
      in Parma, the center of his greatest activity. The frescoes he painted in the dome
      of the cathedral there served as a model of dome decorations long after his death.
      Correggio inspired future generations of artists as diverse as the Carracci family,
      Rubens, and Boucher. Italian painter, muralist.
      Antonio Allegri da Correggio.
