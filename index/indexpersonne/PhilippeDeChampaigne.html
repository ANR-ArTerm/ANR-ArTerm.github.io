   <p>Rôle : 
      He was known as one of the greatest portrait painters of 17th-century France. His
      art
      was based in an analytical study of appearances and on psychological truth. He was
      also
      one of the principal instigators of the Classical tendency and a founder-member of
      the
      Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. He developed an interest in Jansenist
      thinking, typified by a severe plainness of style. His career overall is marked by
      a
      successful integration of foreign elements into French culture and as the representative
      of the most intellectual current of French painting, having developed from late
      Mannerism and moving into powerful Baroque images, influenced as much by the Flemish
      Rubens as by Vouet, and ending with an aesthetic vision of the world and of humanity.
      Flemish painter. Comment on works: Religious; Portraits; History; Vanitas with skull;
