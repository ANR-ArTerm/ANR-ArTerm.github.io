   <p>Rôle : 
      Masaccio's father was the notary Ser Giovanni di Mone (Simone) Cassai. When Ser
      Giovanni died in 1406, Masaccio's mother, Jacopa di Martinozzo di Dino, married Tedesco
      di Feo, an apothecary in Masaccio's native San Giovanni (located between Florence
      and
      Arezzo). Masaccio is recorded as a "painter" by the age of 16, and a few years later
      he
      was listed among painters in the guild records of the Arte de' Medici e Speziali.
      It is
      a tradition that Masaccio's master was Masolino, with whom he later often collaborated;
      however, this is unlikely because Masolino was not a member of the painters' guild
      until
      1423, and thus would not have had apprentices during Masaccio's youth. Masaccio is
      often
      noted as the founder of Italian Renaissance painting, because he learned from the
      intial
      experiments of Giotto to create figures, drapery, and objects as fully three-dimensional
      with gravitational weight. In addition, his pictorial space is arranged by using linear
      perspective, light and shadow are portrayed as if light were entering this space from
      a
      single source, and his figures appear to be present, conscious characters who react
      and
      display emotion. Giorgio Vasari, a 16th-century biographer of artists, explained that
      Masaccio followed in the footsteps of sculptors Brunelleschi and Donatello, even though
      he worked in the medium of painting.
